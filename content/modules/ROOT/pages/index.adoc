== Introduction


This workshop provides hands-on experience in building scalable and reliable event-driven applications for agentic AI workflows using Apache Kafka and Red Hat OpenShift, leveraging the power of modern Java tools like Quarkus.

== Workshop Goal

In this workshop you will learn how Globex implements an event-driven, agentic AI applications using Apache Kafka for streaming and Quarkus with LangChain4J/LangGraph4J extensions for business logic and LLM orchestration.

=== Target Audience

This workshop is suitable for Application Developers, Architects, and AI/ML Engineers interested in integrating AI capabilities into existing enterprise applications.


== The story behind this workshop

In this workshop we will follow the story of *{corp}*, a fictitious retail company with an e-commerce platform. 


Globex wants to now extend their eCommerce website to allow customers to leave their reviews of the product catalogue. They would like to

* Moderate the language comments to ensure foul language is appropriately filtered out
* Build a Sentiment Analysis system to gain business intelligence based on the product reviews
* Provide a concise summary of the reviews for each product to help customers make informed purchasing decisions


Before the age of LLM, processing of reviews was a bit hit or miss but with LLMs processing the reviews and summarizing the review and do all kind of analysis on reviews submitted by users becomes much easier. 

=== Solution overview

To reliably moderate and summarize the user-submitted reviews, Globex adopts an asynchronous event-driven architecture with Apache Kafka, leveraging LLMs for advanced analysis. They choose to use Quarkus as their application framework due to its seamless integration with Kafka and LLM libraries like LangChain4j and LangGraph4j.


== Technologies You Will Use

* Container Platform: Red Hat OpenShift
* Application Runtime: Quarkus with LangChain4j and LangGraph4j extensions to build AI-infused applications
* Apache Kafka for messaging and event streaming
* Persistence with MongoDB
* Security: Keycloak (for OIDC/OAuth)
* LLM Provider: OpenAI GPT-4 via API


== Workshop Architecture Overview

* The front-end application allows users to submit reviews and view product summaries. It interacts with Keycloak for authentication and authorization, ensuring secure access to the review submission and summary features.
* Review Processor Agent: This Quarkus-based service consumes user-submitted reviews from the `review-intake` Kafka topic. It uses an LLM to moderate the content and generate personalized thank-you emails. Moderated reviews are then published to the `review-processed` topic.
* Review Summary Agent: This Quarkus-based service listens to the `review-processed` topic. It summarized the product reviewsusing an LLM to generate concise summaries, which are then stored in MongoDB for retrieval by the front-end application.

Since it is not possible to build all of the components in a single workshop, we will focus on building primarily the two agentic applications (Review Processor and Review Summarizer) and demonstrate the end-to-end workflow using a pre-built front-end application.

== Workshop Modules

This workshop is divided into the following modules:

* Module 1: Enviroment walkthrough and prerequisites
* Module 2: Building the Review Processor Agentic Application
* Module 3: Building the Review Summary Agentic Application
* Module 4: Testing and Demonstration
* Conclusion: Workshop Summary and Next Steps
